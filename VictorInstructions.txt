Matlab programs for analyzing data.

I would really like to be able to look at the spectra
that we take and do image processing in Matlab.

I've attached my STM library from PhD to this e-mail.
It may be helpful, but it also may not since the data
was in a different format.

The basic thing we need is a program that plots an
image and marks the points where the spectra were taken,
and then also plots the spectra.

Stuff we need to do:

- second derivative
- average several spectra together
- plot over different voltage ranges
- scale the spectra
- change colors
