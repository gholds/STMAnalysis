# STM Analysis Library

The `STMAnalysis` library is a small Python package for analysis of STM data. Built on [Nanonispy](https://github.com/underchemist/nanonispy) for data importing, it extends this library to do common analysis in the STM field.

## Installation

To install, simply download the repository from this github page. The library is dependent on the following packages:

* [Nanonispy](https://github.com/underchemist/nanonispy)
* [Numpy](www.numpy.org) for manipulation of data
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) for plotting
* [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for unit conversion

In the future, I will put the package PyPI so that you can download using `pip install STMAnalysis`.
